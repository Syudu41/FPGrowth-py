# FPTree Function - Data Mining
The FPTree Algorithm is used in Data Mining for frequent itemsets within transactions given a threshold support. This Python file requires a `vocab.txt` file and a `topic.txt` file as shown in this repo. 

## INSTRUCTIONS:
- Run all the functions above before providing the input.
- Make sure to enter the `vocab.txt` file.
- Make sure to enter the correct `topic-x.txt` file as the input file.
- Similarly, make sure to change the name of the output file as `pattern-x.txt`, failing which the outputs would be overwritten on the same file.
